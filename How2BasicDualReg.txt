To do Dual-Regression for the purpose of using the results for denoising run it like this from the SHELL (this is a shell script using FSL functions):


dual_regression_residuals melodic_IC 1 -1 0 DualRegOutputDirName `cat .filelist`


NB: dual_regression_residuals is my special version of Dual Regression that also outputs the residuals after ICA, i.e. all the data that was NOT in the ICA.
    This can then also be removed by the denoising algorithm, but it is recommended that you do not remove it.
NB2: IF YOU NEVER PLAN TO REMOVE THE RESIDUALS AND NEVER USE THAT OPTION IN THE DENOISING, THEN YOU CAN JUST USE THE "NORMAL" DUAL-REGRESSION FUNCTION "dual_regression"
NB3: You have to make sure that "dual_regression_residuals" was made executable, before you try to run it! (chmod +x ...) 
     You only need to do this once, or better ask you Admin to do this, (s)he would definitely like to feel that (s)he made a contribution today! ;)
